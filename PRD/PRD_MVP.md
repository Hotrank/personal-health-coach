## Personal Health Coach MVP

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Personal Health Coach is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users track their health, receive personalized advice, and stay consistent with healthy habits. The MVP focuses on retrieving and updating personal health data, providing basic health advice, and sending reminders.

### 1.2 Scope

The MVP will include:

- Health data retrieval
- Secure health data updates
- Basic personalized health recommendations

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Read/Search Personal Health Info

- As a user, I want to ask about my health history (e.g., "What was my cholesterol level 6 months ago?") so I can track my progress.
- As a user, I want to receive a summary of my recent health status (e.g., "How is my health this week?") to quickly review trends.

### 2.2 Securely Update Personal Health Info

- As a user, I want to log new health data via chat (e.g., "I weigh 135 lbs today") so my records stay updated.
- As a user, I want to correct past health records (e.g., "Actually, my weight last week was 138 lbs") so my data remains accurate.

### 2.3 Ask for Health Advice

- As a user, I want to ask for meal recommendations based on my health data (e.g., "What should I eat for dinner based on my cholesterol level?") to make better dietary choices.
- As a user, I want the system to suggest workouts tailored to my fitness level (e.g., "What type of workout should I do today?") so I can stay active.
